## How to Use this thing

So there are is a lot new here. To use github effectively you need to overcome your fear of the Command Promt. This is the blackbox of Windows. To access your Command Promt just type into the search field in the lower left hand corner __cmd__ . From there you have to navigate to where you want your github file to be. 

To change the working directory in the command promt you need something that looks like this:

C:/Users/Documents/{Folder you want you project to live}
The whole command will look like this

cd C:/Users/Documents/{Folder you want you project to live}

The you need to look at this website and follow the appropriate steps applicable to your given situation

## The Rmardown file itself

There is no specific rule on how you answer questions from the book but there are some rules for the headers.

In Rmarkdown headers are denoted as:

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5

For chapter names we use header 1
For specific Questions we are answering we use header 2
For sub-sections of a question we use header 3 but as follows

## Ex 1.3 Air pollution and birth outcomes, study components (s.19)
### 1.3 a
### 1.3 b

As the example is we write Ex for Exercises Its number and question followed by the PDFs page number
There after we use header 3 for sub-sections of each question. 

Any code that we write in R needs to be clearly written. For consistency lets try and keep to clean code, meaning the code that solves the question is the only code we use in the coding section.

### Rmarkdown Code section

Rmarkdown is not like an R script. R scripts are used when you want to write code (just like in Python). Rmarkdown is more versiyle, offering us to output our Rmarkdown into HTML, PDF or Word documents. The only difference is that when we want to write R code, for windows you need to write Alt+Ctrl+I and into this area all R code for that section must be entered. 

## Extra info

The Rmarkdown cheetsheet is fantastic to use. If you cant find it on our shared Onedrive then google Rmarkdown cheetsheet Rstudio and that way you will get it.
